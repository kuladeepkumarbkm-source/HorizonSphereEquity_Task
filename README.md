# NSBLPA Prototype

## How to Run Locally

Open any HTML file in a browser. Works offline â€” no backend, no build step needed.

## Assumptions and Design

- All design is mobile-first and responsive, inspired by nfl.com, SalesBets, and fvnsport.com.
- All navigation is semantic and accessible.
- All links (teams, apps) open in new tabs as required.
- Assets can be customized.
- Vanilla ES6 JS, no dependencies, works fully offline.

## Assets

Logos use text-initials for now.
